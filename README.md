# pyspark-performance-tuning
This repo is used to document some approaches that I personally have used for spark performance tuning.

Note: I am learning mkdocs and documenting this article will enable me to improve my understanding
Additionally since mkdocs uses YAML for configuration, this will enhance my current understanding in it as well.
#### Feel free to fork this repo to try out mkdocs.
